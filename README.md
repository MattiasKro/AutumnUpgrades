# AutumnUpgrades
Relay script for KoLmafia, for the web game Kingdom of Loathing. Helps finding where to find upgrades for the Autumn-aton.

## Installation:

Run the following int the Graphical CLI in KolMafia

```git checkout MattiasKro/AutumnUpgrades```

## Description:

Groups possible destinations after what upgrade they provide, and marks upgrades not yet collected with an asterisk (*). I also added a short reminder of what the standard Autumn reward is for that destination type.
Moved the button to send away the Atumn-aton to the right side and gave it a green color, because I often clicked the wrong button and just went back to the inventory.

## Example:
